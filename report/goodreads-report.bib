  abstract = {Current nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) deals with X = F GT type. We provide a systematic analysis and extensions of NMF to the symmetric W = HHT , and the weighted W = HSHT . We show that (1) W = HHT is equivalent to Kernel K-means clustering and the Laplacian-based spectral clustering. (2) X = F GT is equivalent to simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a bipartite graph. Algorithms are given for computing these symmetric NMFs.},

  title = {Regularizing {{Matrix Factorization}} with {{User}} and {{Item Embeddings}} for {{Recommendation}}},
  abstract = {Following recent successes in exploiting both latent factor and word embedding models in recommendation, we propose a novel Regularized Multi-Embedding (RME) based recommendation model that simultaneously encapsulates the following ideas via decomposition: (1) which items a user likes, (2) which two users co-like the same items, (3) which two items users often co-liked, and (4) which two items users often co-disliked. In experimental validation, the RME outperforms competing state-of-the-art models in both explicit and implicit feedback datasets, significantly improving Recall@5 by 5.9\textasciitilde{}7.0\%, NDCG@20 by 4.3\textasciitilde{}5.6\%, and MAP@10 by 7.9\textasciitilde{}8.9\%. In addition, under the cold-start scenario for users with the lowest number of interactions, against the competing models, the RME outperforms NDCG@5 by 20.2\% and 29.4\% in MovieLens-10M and MovieLens-20M datasets, respectively. Our datasets and source code are available at: https://github.com/thanhdtran/RME.git.},

  volume = {1},
  issn = {2096-0654},
  abstract = {In recent years, the recommendation systems have become increasingly popular and have been used in a broad variety of applications. Here, we investigate the matrix completion techniques for the recommendation systems that are based on collaborative filtering. The collaborative filtering problem can be viewed as predicting the favorability of a user with respect to new items of commodities. When a rating matrix is constructed with users as rows, items as columns, and entries as ratings, the collaborative filtering problem can then be modeled as a matrix completion problem by filling out the unknown elements in the rating matrix. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the matrix completion methods used in recommendation systems. We focus on the mathematical models for matrix completion and the corresponding computational algorithms as well as their characteristics and potential issues. Several applications other than the traditional user-item association prediction are also discussed.},
